"""Remove daily_allocations JSON column from tasks table.

Revision ID: 006_remove_daily_allocations_json
Revises: 005_add_daily_allocations_table
Create Date: 2026-02-01

This migration removes the daily_allocations JSON column from the tasks table.
Daily allocations are now stored exclusively in the normalized daily_allocations
table, which provides:
- SQL-native aggregation (SUM, GROUP BY for workload calculations)
- Efficient date range queries
- Atomic updates per date
- Database-level constraints

Prerequisites:
- Migration 005 must have been run (creates the daily_allocations table)
- Dual-write should have been active, ensuring all data is in the normalized table
