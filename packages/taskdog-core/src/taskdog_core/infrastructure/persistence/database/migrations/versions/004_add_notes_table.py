"""Add notes table for database-based note storage.

Revision ID: 004_add_notes_table
Revises: 003_make_priority_nullable
Create Date: 2026-01-29

This migration adds a notes table to store task notes in the database
instead of the filesystem. This eliminates N filesystem stat() calls
per task list request, improving performance.

Notes are automatically deleted when their parent task is deleted via
ON DELETE CASCADE foreign key constraint.
